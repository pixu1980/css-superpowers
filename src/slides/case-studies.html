    <h4>Re-branding</h4>
    <small>
      <p>
        Re-branding is the process of redefining the identity of a product, company, or service to reflect a new vision,
        updated values, or a change in market positioning. This process may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Updating Logo and Aesthetics: New colors, typography, and visual styles</li>
        <li>Redefining Tone of Voice: New language or communication to connect with a different audience</li>
        <li>Renewed Positioning: Adapting the brand to attract new customer segments or respond to market changes</li>
        <li>Revamping User Experience: Changing the design of the website, apps, and all visual touchpoints</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Goal: Create a more modern perception in line with the target audience, increasing competitiveness and fostering
        an emotional connection with customers.

    <h4>Re-selling</h4>
    <small>
      <p>
        Re-selling is the process of reselling an existing product to new customers or markets, adapting it to meet each
        customer's specific needs without creating a new product from scratch. This process may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Aesthetic Customization: Adapting colors, logo, and typography for new customers</li>
        <li>
          Multi-Tenant Design: Making the product easily configurable for multiple customers without altering the main
          code
        </li>
        <li>Scalability: Creating a product that is flexible and ready to be adapted efficiently for new customers</li>
        <li>
          Code Reusability: Avoiding duplication and keeping the code modular to reduce implementation costs and time
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Goal: Maximize the profitability of an existing product by adapting it for new sales while ensuring efficiency
        and maintainability.

    <h4>Multi-tenant</h4>
    <small>
      <p>
        Multi-tenant is a software architecture in which a single instance of an application serves multiple customers
        (tenants), maintaining data and customization separation for each one. Each customer shares the same codebase
        but sees the application as if it were a unique instance.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Resource Sharing: Infrastructure and resources are shared among tenants, reducing management costs</li>
        <li>
          Customization for Each Tenant: Ability to apply branding and functionality customizations without modifying
          the main application
        </li>
        <li>Operational Efficiency: Maintaining a single codebase makes updates easier and reduces maintenance time</li>
        <li>Scalability and Security: Each tenant can be logically isolated to ensure security and scalability</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Goal: Maximize operational efficiency and scalability, allowing each customer to have a personalized experience
        without compromising system centralization.
